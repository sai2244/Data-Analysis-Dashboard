#IMDb-Data-Analysis(Interactive Dashboard creation using PowerBi)
##Project Objective
The objective of creating an IMDb Dataset Dashboard using Power BI is to analyze and visualize movie-related data to gain insights into industry trends, performance metrics, and audience preferences.

##Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/sai2244/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/imdb_top_1000.csv">Dataset</a>

##Questions(KPIs)
- Which director has the most votes for their movies?
- What are the top-rated genres based on IMDb ratings?
- How does the number of votes correlate with meta scores?
- What is the average IMDb rating for different genres and directors?
- Which movies have the highest first-weekend gross collections?
- How has the number of movies released per year changed over time?
- Has the IMDb rating trend improved or declined over time?
- What is the distribution of meta scores over the years?
- What is the most popular movie certificate (A, U, UA, etc.) based on votes?
- Which certifications dominate certain genres?
- How do different genres compare in terms of audience engagement (votes & ratings)?
- Which actors receive the most votes for their movies?
- Who are the top 5 actors with the highest-rated movies?
- What is the relationship between actor popularity and IMDb ratings?

##Process
- Import and Clean Data: Load the IMDb dataset into Power BI, remove duplicates, handle missing values, and format columns using Power Query Editor.
- Data Modeling: Establish relationships between tables (e.g., Movies, Directors, Actors) and create calculated columns or DAX measures like Total Votes, Avg IMDb Rating, and Highest Grossing Movie.
- Create Visualizations: Design bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and KPI cards to analyze movie performance, genre trends, director impact, actor popularity, and revenue insights.
- Enhance Interactivity: Add slicers, filters, and drill-through to allow users to explore data dynamically by genre, year, director, or rating.
- Publish and Optimize: Publish the dashboard to Power BI Service, schedule data refresh, format UI for better readability, and ensure insights are clear and actionable.

##Project insights
- Director & Actor Impact: The dashboard reveals that certain directors consistently receive high IMDb ratings, with Christoper Nolan and Steven Spielberg among the most voted directors. Similarly, actors like Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson have high audience engagement.
- Genre Popularity: Drama and Action genres dominate in both ratings and number of votes, while animated and documentary films have lower engagement but often receive high critic scores.
- Yearly Trends: The number of movies released peaked in recent years, but the average IMDb rating has shown a decline, indicating increased competition and changing audience preferences.
- Financial Insights: Big-budget movies tend to have higher gross revenue, but some low-budget films achieve high IMDb ratings, proving that storytelling matters as much as production value.
- Meta Score vs. IMDb Rating: There is a weak correlation between critic (Meta Score) and audience ratings, suggesting that critics and viewers often have different perspectives on movie quality.

##Final Conclusion
- The IMDb Data Dashboard reveals key trends in movie popularity, director influence, and genre preferences. Drama and Action dominate, while high-budget films earn more revenue, though low-budget movies with strong storytelling still succeed. Movie releases have increased, but IMDb ratings have slightly declined, reflecting changing audience tastes. Lastly, critics and audiences often have differing opinions, as shown by the weak correlation between IMDb ratings and Meta Scores.
