##Process
- Import and Clean Data: Load the IMDb dataset into Power BI, remove duplicates, handle missing values, and format columns using Power Query Editor.
- Data Modeling: Establish relationships between tables (e.g., Movies, Directors, Actors) and create calculated columns or DAX measures like Total Votes, Avg IMDb Rating, and Highest Grossing Movie.
- Create Visualizations: Design bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and KPI cards to analyze movie performance, genre trends, director impact, actor popularity, and revenue insights.
- Enhance Interactivity: Add slicers, filters, and drill-through to allow users to explore data dynamically by genre, year, director, or rating.
- Publish and Optimize: Publish the dashboard to Power BI Service, schedule data refresh, format UI for better readability, and ensure insights are clear and actionable.
